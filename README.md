I'm thinking about a lake. It's technically a private lake, but every once in a while some visitors I don't recognize show up. It isn't crystal clear or anything, the best you'll get is a distorted reflection. Don't get me wrong though, it's teeming with life under the surface. I've been fishing here as far back as I can remember. Caught plenty over the years, but as much as I might say I know what I'm doing, it's mostly just a mix of instinct and luck. Welcome to ameet.xyz, the scuba gear of this overextended metaphor. The goal: to wade through and un-muddy the water of my mind. As I think and do, I'll deposit the minerals that surface, and hopefully over time some patterns will emerge that can help me figure out who I am, for the moment at least. I'd like for you to contribute as much as possible, because you are just as much a part of me as I am. </p>

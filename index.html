			<p> I'm thinking about a lake. It's technically a private lake, but every once in a while some visitors I don't recognize show up. It isn't crystal clear or anything, the best you'll get is a distorted reflection. Don't get me wrong though, it's teeming with life under the surface. I've been fishing here as far back as I can remember. Caught plenty over the years, but it's mostly been a mix of instinct and luck. Welcome to ameet.xyz, the scuba gear of this overextended metaphor. The goal: to wade through and un-muddy the water of my mind. As I think and do, I'll deposit the minerals that surface, and hopefully over time some patterns will emerge that can help me figure out who I am, for the moment at least. I'd like for you to contribute as much as possible, because you are just as much a part of me as I am. </p>

		<p>A compelling plot that follows the rules it sets for its world, acting that suspends my disbelief, direction that makes me feel like I was there, cinemetagraphy that makes me wish I was. Some faves:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fantastic Mr. Fox</li>
			<li>Fight Club</li>

		<h6 class="list-item-header">Books</h6>
		<p>Imho, the less given sensory experience, the more room for subjective interpretation and imagination, so it's harder to rank books than movies. But here's some faves right now:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Siddhartha</li>
			<li>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</li>
